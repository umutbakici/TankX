Case Study- Triangular Arbitrage 

In this study, I tried to create a program that finds triangular arbitrage opportunities.
In binance_pairs.py, all parity on the Binance is observed. After all the parity is observed, we select a group of parities that can have possibly triangular arbitrage chance by arbitrage_pairs.py. 
There are certain limitations on the Binance websocket so we limit our data mining.
