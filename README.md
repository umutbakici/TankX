Case Study- Triangular Arbitrage 

This program is designed to engage in triangular arbitrage on the Binance platform by utilizing the Binance WebSocket for data retrieval.

The script is getting the ticker data of the specific transactions. 

In binance_pairs.py, all parity on the Binance is observed. After all the parity is observed, we select a group of parities that can have possibly triangular arbitrage chance by arbitrage_pairs.py. 
There are certain limitations on the Binance websocket so we limit our data mining.
